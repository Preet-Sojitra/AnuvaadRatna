## Usage:

To use Anuvaad Ratna, you need to run it on your local machine only as of now. To do so, follow these steps:

> You need to clone both the frontend and backend repositories to your local machine separately and start the servers for both of them separately.

1. Clone the repository using following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/AnuvaadRatna
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository and install the dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the server using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Now head over to the [backend repository](https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/sih_flask) and follow the instructions given there to start the backend server.

## Future Plans:

We plan to add support for more languages to Anuvaad Ratna in the future. We also plan to improve the accuracy of the translations and to add new features, such as the ability to translate images.
